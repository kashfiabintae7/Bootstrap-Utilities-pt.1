          Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles,
          California, on December 18, 2001.
          <a href="#"><sup>[8] </sup></a>She is the daughter of actress and
          teacher
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Baird">Maggie Baird</a
          ><a href="#"><sup>[9][10]</sup></a>
          and actor Patrick O'Connell,
          <a href="h#"><sup>[11] </sup></a>both of whom are also musicians and
          work on Eilish's tours.
          <a href="#"><sup>[12][13][14]</sup></a>
          Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.
          <a href="#"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
          She was conceived via in vitro fertilization.
          <a href="#"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
          Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name,
          while Pirate was to have been her middle name. But after her
          grandfather William Baird died while her mother was pregnant, her
          parents decided to name her Billie, after her grandfather.
          <a href="#"><sup>[17] </sup></a>She grew up in Los Angeles's Highland
          Park neighborhood.

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finneas_O%27Connell"></a
          >Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to
          spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their
          interests. <a href="#"><sup>[11][14]</sup></a
          >Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting. Eilish
          said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.
          <a href="#"><sup>[21] </sup></a>Their parents encouraged the siblings
          to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art,
          dancing, and acting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eilish started playing the ukulele at age six. She performed at talent
          shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.
          <a href="#"><sup>[22][20][23]</sup></a> She wrote her first "real"
          song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about
          the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series

            >The Walking Dead,</a
          >
          from which she took script lines and episode titles.
          <a href="#"><sup>[24][21] </sup></a>Eilish took some acting auditions,
          which she disliked, but she enjoyed recording background dialogue for
          crowd scenes and worked on the films
